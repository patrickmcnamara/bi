# Bad Image (`.bi`/`.biz`)

`bi` is a library for the `BI`/`BIZ` image format.
The `BI` format encodes images so that they are essentially CSV files using the named colors in the [CSS Color Module Level 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#named-colors).
This means that they are plaintext editable.
Nice.

The `BIZ` format is the same except it is gzipped.
